Scheduling Algorithms Project

This repository contains the implementation of various scheduling algorithms as part of the "Systemprogrammierung" course at TU Berlin.

In this project, I explored and implemented several scheduling algorithms commonly used in operating systems. Scheduling algorithms are crucial for managing the execution of processes. They determine the order in which processes are executed on the CPU.

The following scheduling algorithms have been implemented:
-FCFS: First-Come, First-Served
-LCFS: Last-Come, First-Served
-PRIOP: Priority Scheduling (Preemptive)
-SRTN: Shortest Remaining Time Next
-HRRN: Highest Response Ratio Next
-RR: Round Robin
-MLF: Multilevel Feedback Queue
